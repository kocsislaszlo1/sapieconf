        <h2>About The Event</h2>
        <p>Before the Covid-19 pandemic, globalization had already been showing a slowing tendency due to a number of global trade interventions, rising tariff rates on imports, the tensions between software and hardware industries players in China and the US, the new short-sighted political responses to the different social challenges, etc. Yet the new lockdown throughout 2020 has brought many disruptions, mainly in the supply chains of multinational players, cancelled exports of goods, while total shutdown of travel industry has hit hard on most of the economy. However, some services thrive because of the growing online presence of economic operators, online shopping is gaining ground, and, in general, the Internet economy shows a further increase. The Quo Vadis question is now whether we are moving towards a divided world where economy is going to be rearranged according to the new political powers in the East and the West, or whether we can achieve a new sustainable balance between interdependent global multinationals and resilient, local industries,  the latter more present on online markets than before. </p>
